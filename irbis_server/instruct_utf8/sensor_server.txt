How do I get the CPU temperature?

After you install lm-sensors:
===========================
sudo apt install lm-sensors
run:
=======================
sudo sensors-detect
you can run the following command to view hardware temps:
===================
watch -n 1 sensors
Also, the fan is usually controled by BIOS.Another good tool is i7z
for Intel Core processors:
=====================
sudo apt install i7z
sudo i7z
and because i7z
runs like top
, there is no need to use watch
